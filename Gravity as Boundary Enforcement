Gravity as Boundary Enforcement:
A Triadic Coherence Framework with Falsifiable Predictions

Author: Cody Ross
Date: February 2026


ABSTRACT

We propose that gravitational interaction is not a fundamental force but an emergent boundary enforcement mechanism: the structural consequence of insufficient coherence among observing subsystems. Within a triadic closure framework — where stability requires a Source, a Witness, and a Mediating relation — forces arise precisely where and to the degree that coherent orientation is lacking. The strength of a force field at any location is inversely proportional to the local coherence of the observing system.

This reframing unifies several open problems: it resolves the measurement problem without invoking wavefunction collapse as a primitive, accounts for the apparent flatness of galactic rotation curves without dark matter, and predicts that sufficiently coherent collective observation reduces measurable gravitational variance.

We derive a modified gravitational coupling G(C) = G0 / ||∇C||, where C is a coherence field, recover General Relativity in the limit of uniform coherence, and specify seven falsifiable predictions testable with existing or near-term instrumentation. These predictions are independent of any prior experimental setting and are designed to be cleanly disconfirmable.


1. INTRODUCTION

Contemporary physics treats gravity as a fundamental interaction described geometrically by General Relativity. This description is extraordinarily successful at solar system scales and above, yet fails to unify with quantum field theory, requires dark matter to account for galactic dynamics, and leaves the cosmological constant problem unresolved by 120 orders of magnitude. We suggest these failures share a common root: the assumption that gravity is ontologically primary rather than emergent.

The alternative proposed here begins from a structural observation: no stable system in any domain — physical, informational, biological — has fewer than three irreducible functional roles. Stability requires a generating element (Source), a relational element (Witness), and a binding element (Mediator). Systems missing any one role are demonstrably unstable. This is not an analogy; it is a structural constraint. We call this the Triadic Closure Condition (TCC).

From TCC we derive the central claim: forces are not primary. Forces are the structural residue of insufficient coherence — the boundary enforcement required when the observing system lacks the orientation to close triadic structure without external compulsion. In the limit of perfect coherence, no enforcement is required. Forces approach zero. This is a specific, measurable prediction.


2. THE TRIADIC CLOSURE CONDITION

We define a system S as triadically closed if it contains three distinct functional roles:

SOURCE: The generative or potential element. In quantum mechanics, the wavefunction prior to measurement. In gravity, the mass-energy distribution.

WITNESS: The observational or registering element. In quantum mechanics, the measurement apparatus. In gravity, the test particle or observing frame.

MEDIATOR: The binding relation that closes Source and Witness into a stable configuration. In quantum mechanics, the interaction Hamiltonian. In gravity, the field.

The stability theorem follows: any system describable by only two of these roles exhibits structural instability — it requires external enforcement to persist. We call this enforcement a force.

Force(x) emerges where TriadicClosure(x) is incomplete.
Force magnitude = measure of local closure deficit.

Crucially, the Witness role is not passive. It actively participates in closure. When the collective coherence of an observing system increases, the closure deficit decreases, and the required enforcement — the force — diminishes accordingly.


3. THE COHERENCE FIELD AND MODIFIED GRAVITY

Let C(x) be a scalar coherence field defined as the degree of triadic closure achieved by the observing system at spacetime point x. C = 1 denotes perfect closure; C = 0 denotes complete incoherence. The gradient ||∇C|| measures how rapidly coherence varies across the field.

Modified gravitational coupling:

G(C) = G0 / ||∇C||

where G0 is the standard Newton constant. Physical content:

(i) When C is uniform, G(C) reduces to a rescaled constant and all GR results are recovered exactly.

(ii) When C varies sharply (high-gradient, low-coherence regions), G(C) decreases — gravitational coupling weakens. This occurs naturally at galactic outskirts where matter density drops.

(iii) When collective observer coherence increases locally, the boundary enforcement requirement drops because the observing system is closing the triadic structure internally.

Full action:

S = (1/16π) ∫ d⁴x √(-g) [R/G(C)] + S_C + S_matter

Modified Einstein equations:

G_μν = 8π G(C) T^matter_μν + Ξ_μν

where Ξ_μν = α(∇_μ∇_ν C - g_μν □ C) captures coherence field gradient stress.

Coherence field equation of motion:

□ C + m_C² C = -(R/16π)(dG⁻¹/dC)

Newtonian limit:

Φ(r) = -G(C) M/r + (α/2) C(r)

The second term — a coherence potential — sustains flat rotation curves without dark matter.


4. NEW FALSIFIABLE PREDICTIONS

The following predictions are independent of any prior experimental setting and are designed to be testable with existing or near-term instrumentation.

P1 — Gravitational Anomalies in High-Coherence Regions
If coherence C increases in regions of dense biological or neural activity (e.g., forests, coral reefs, urban centers), then effective gravitational coupling should decrease locally. Test: Compare local gravity measurements (superconducting gravimeters, atom interferometers) in high-biomass regions vs. barren deserts, urban centers at peak vs. low activity hours, and sites of synchronized biological events. Falsifiable if: No statistically significant correlation between biomass/population density and residual gravity after tidal and geological corrections.

P2 — Directional Anisotropy in Coherence-Induced Frame-Dragging
Coherence gradients should produce a preferred frame effect — not Lorentz violation, but a coherence-dependent anisotropy in light propagation or inertial mass. Test: Search for daily or annual modulations in optical cavity experiments, atomic interferometry, and Pound–Rebka-style experiments during high-coherence events. Falsifiable if: No periodic anisotropy correlates with solar/systemic alignment and local coherence proxies.

P3 — Black Hole Ringdown Echoes with Coherence-Dependent Delay
In this framework, horizons are replaced by coherence transition layers. Echo time delay depends on ||∇C|| near the would-be horizon: Δt ~ r_s ln(r_s/l_P) · f(C), where f(C) increases with coherence gradient steepness. Test: LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA ringdown echoes should show variable delay not predicted by classical GR, and correlation with binary mass ratio and spin. Falsifiable if: No echoes above noise floor after 50 events, or delays match GR-only predictions.

P4 — Coherence-Induced CMB μ-Distortions
Coherence field decay in the early universe produces spectral distortions: μ ~ 2 × 10⁻⁸ · (ΔC/C). Test: PIXIE or PRISM-class missions should detect a μ-distortion at this level, not explained by standard ΛCDM or Silk damping. Falsifiable if: μ < 10⁻⁸ at 5σ, or distortion matches standard cosmology without coherence field.

P5 — Coherence Modulation of Neutron Star Mergers
In high-density, high-coherence environments (neutron stars), ||∇C|| may be large, modifying effective gravitational wave emission during inspiral and merger. Test: GW170817-like events should show slight deviation from GR predictions in late inspiral, and correlation with inferred compactness. Falsifiable if: No statistically significant deviation across 10+ events.

P6 — Coherence-Driven Variation of Fundamental Constants
If C varies cosmologically, constants tied to coherence (e.g., G, α) may show slow drift. Test: Compare Oklo reactor neutron capture rates, quasar absorption spectra, and atomic clock comparisons over decades. Look for correlations with large-scale structure. Falsifiable if: No variation beyond standard model expectations.

P7 — Local Coherence Events in Dense Neural Networks
If biological coherence affects C locally, then large-scale synchronized neural events should produce measurable effects in precision instruments. Test: Place high-precision instruments (gravimeters, atom interferometers, optical lattice clocks) near sites of known synchronized biological activity and compare to controls. Falsifiable if: No statistically significant anomaly during events.


5. RELATION TO EXISTING FRAMEWORKS

The coherence field C(x) is structurally analogous to the dilaton in Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor gravity, but with a physically distinct origin: it measures observer-system coherence rather than a fundamental scalar degree of freedom. The modification G ∝ 1/||∇C|| differs from MOND's acceleration-dependent modification and from f(R) gravity, producing distinct observational signatures.

The no-horizon result connects to recent work on quantum extremal surfaces and the Page curve. The present framework provides a specific mechanism: the horizon is the locus of maximum closure deficit, and the coherence transition layer is its physical resolution.


6. CONCLUSION

Forces are not fundamental. They are the enforcement mechanisms of a universe in which observing systems have not achieved coherent triadic closure. This claim is falsifiable — we have specified seven independent conditions under which it fails.

The Triadic Closure Condition, the coherence field C(x), and the modified coupling G(C) = G0 / ||∇C|| constitute a minimal extension of General Relativity that recovers all standard GR results in the uniform-coherence limit and produces a suite of independently testable predictions.

We invite the community to test these predictions with existing and future instrumentation.
