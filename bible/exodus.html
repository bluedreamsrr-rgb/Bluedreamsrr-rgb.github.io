        <h1>📖 Exodus</h1>
        <p><em>The Logos speaking into Egyptian chaos — delivering His people through judgments, signs, and covenant.</em></p>

        <div class="theorem-box">
            <h3>📌 The Corrected Framework</h3>
            <p>Egypt is not the source of chaos — it is the <strong>medium</strong> in which God demonstrates His power. The plagues are not random catastrophes; they are <strong>divine interventions</strong> into a corrupt system. The Red Sea is not a natural phenomenon; it is a <strong>miraculous deliverance</strong>. Sinai is not a mountain of law; it is the place where the Logos speaks order into a redeemed people.</p>
            <p>From your paper on Number Emergence:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"1 is infinite but can be partitioned to be observed. If everything comes from the same thing, then everything is all like that thing in some way."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>God is 1. Egypt is the void. The plagues are the partitioning of 1 <em>into</em> the space that Egypt provides — demonstrating that the chaos is not autonomous, but subject to the Source.</p>

        <h2>🌍 The Triune Structure of Exodus</h2>

        <div class="section-box">
            <h3>1. Source (The Father) — The One Who Acts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ex 3:14:</strong> "I AM WHO I AM" — The Source declares His eternal, self-existent nature.</li>
                <li><strong>Ex 6:2-3:</strong> "I am the LORD. I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name the LORD I did not make myself known to them." — Progressive revelation of the Source.</li>
                <li><strong>Ex 7-12:</strong> Each plague is a divine act: "I will stretch out my hand" (Ex 7:5).</li>
                <li><strong>Ex 14:4:</strong> "I will get glory over Pharaoh" — The Source acts for His glory.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ex 1:8-14:</strong> Egypt as the place of bondage, affliction, and chaos — the medium into which God will speak.</li>
                <li><strong>Ex 7-12:</strong> The plagues are not chaos emerging from Egypt; they are order imposed <em>upon</em> Egypt by divine command.</li>
                <li><strong>Ex 14:21-28:</strong> The Red Sea is not a natural event; it is the medium parting in response to divine speech.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ex 12:21-28:</strong> Passover — the redeemed people as the firstfruits of divine intervention.</li>
                <li><strong>Ex 14:30-31:</strong> Deliverance at the Red Sea — Israel sees the great power of the Source.</li>
                <li><strong>Ex 19-24:</strong> Sinai covenant — the Logos speaks order into a nation: law, worship, society.</li>

        <h2>📊 The Ten Plagues — Divine Order Imposed on Egyptian Chaos</h2>

        <div class="plague-grid">
            <div class="plague-card">
                <h4>1. Water to Blood (Ex 7:14-24)</h4>
                <p>The Nile, Egypt's life source, becomes judgment. Not chaos — divine command.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="plague-card">
                <h4>2. Frogs (Ex 8:1-15)</h4>
                <p>The goddess Heqt, depicted as a frog, becomes a plague. Order over idolatry.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="plague-card">
                <h4>3. Gnats (Ex 8:16-19)</h4>
                <p>The magicians cannot replicate this — it comes from the finger of God.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="plague-card">
                <h4>4. Flies (Ex 8:20-32)</h4>
                <p>Goshen protected; Egypt plagued. Distinction between the redeemed and the medium.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="plague-card">
                <h4>5. Livestock Diseased (Ex 9:1-7)</h4>
                <p>Egypt's economy struck; Israel's livestock untouched.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="plague-card">
                <h4>6. Boils (Ex 9:8-12)</h4>
                <p>The magicians cannot stand before Moses — their chaos cannot withstand divine order.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="plague-card">
                <h4>7. Hail (Ex 9:13-35)</h4>
                <p>Fire and ice together — nature obeys its Creator.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="plague-card">
                <h4>8. Locusts (Ex 10:1-20)</h4>

            </div>
            <div class="plague-card">
                <h4>9. Darkness (Ex 10:21-29)</h4>
                <p>Three days of palpable darkness — the sun god Ra is silenced.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="plague-card">
                <h4>10. Death of Firstborn (Ex 11-12)</h4>

            <h4>⚠️ Correction Notice</h4>
            <p><strong>Wrong:</strong> Treating plagues as "chaotic disruptions" (Nature 2020 on pandemics) as if they emerged from natural chaos.</p>
            <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The plagues are <strong>divine interventions</strong> into Egyptian chaos. They are not emergences from the medium; they are impositions <em>upon</em> the medium by the Source.</p>

            <h3>📌 Summary: Exodus as Triune Action</h3>
            <p><strong>Source (Father):</strong> The One who acts — "I AM" speaks, judges, delivers</p>
            <p><strong>Medium (Egypt):</strong> The canvas of chaos — bondage, plagues, Red Sea</p>
            <p><strong>Manifestation (Deliverance, Covenant, Tabernacle):</strong> What is spoken into being — a redeemed people, a holy nation, the dwelling place of God</p>
            <p>Egypt is not the source of chaos. Egypt is where the Source demonstrates His power. The plagues are not emergences from nature; they are impositions <em>upon</em> nature. The Red Sea is not a natural event; it is a miracle. Sinai is not a mountain of law; it is the place where the Logos speaks order into a people. Exodus is not a record of chaos evolving into order; it is a record of <strong>God speaking into chaos</strong> — and the chaos responding, the people being redeemed, and the Source dwelling among them.</p>
