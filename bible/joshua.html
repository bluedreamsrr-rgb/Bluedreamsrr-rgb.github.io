        <h1>📖 Joshua</h1>
        <p><em>The Logos speaking into the chaos of Canaan — establishing Israel in the Promised Land through judgment and inheritance.</em></p>

        <div class="theorem-box">
            <h3>📌 The Corrected Framework</h3>
            <p>The conquest of Canaan is not tribal warfare or natural expansion. It is <strong>divine judgment</strong> upon nations whose sin had reached its fullness (Gen 15:16). The walls of Jericho do not fall by natural means; they fall by divine command. The sun stands still not by astronomical anomaly; it stands by the word of Joshua, spoken in faith. The land is not conquered by Israel's military might; it is given by the Source as an inheritance.</p>
            <p>From your paper on Number Emergence:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"1 is infinite but can be partitioned to be observed. If everything comes from the same thing, then everything is all like that thing in some way."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>God is 1. Canaan is the void. The conquest is the partitioning of 1 <em>into</em> the space that Canaan provides — not for Israel's glory, but for the Source's purpose: to establish a people through whom the ultimate Mediator would come.</p>

        <div class="section-box">
            <h3>1. Source (The Father) — The One Who Commands and Gives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Josh 1:1-9:</strong> "Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan." — The Source commissions Joshua, promising His presence.</li>
                <li><strong>Josh 3:7-8:</strong> "Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel." — The Source elevates His mediator.</li>
                <li><strong>Josh 5:13-15:</strong> The commander of the LORD's army appears to Joshua — the Source's divine warrior.</li>
                <li><strong>Josh 6:2:</strong> "See, I have given Jericho into your hand." — Victory is from the Source, not from Israel.</li>
                <li><strong>Josh 13-21:</strong> The land distributed by lot — the Source Himself assigns the inheritance.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Josh 2:</strong> Rahab and the spies — even in Canaan, there is a remnant who fears the Source.</li>
                <li><strong>Josh 6-12:</strong> The conquest — Canaan as the medium of divine judgment, its nations dispossessed for their sin.</li>
                <li><strong>Josh 7:</strong> Achan's sin — chaos enters the camp itself, and must be purged.</li>
                <li><strong>Josh 9:</strong> The Gibeonite deception — the nations use cunning to survive.</li>
                <li><strong>Josh 13-21:</strong> The land divided — the medium transformed into inheritance.</li>

                <li><strong>Josh 1-12:</strong> The conquest — victory through faith, not might.</li>
                <li><strong>Josh 13-21:</strong> The division of the land — each tribe receives its inheritance.</li>
                <li><strong>Josh 20:</strong> Cities of refuge — mercy ordered within judgment.</li>
                <li><strong>Josh 21:43-45:</strong> "Not one word of all the good promises that the LORD had made to the house of Israel had failed; all came to pass." — The Source's faithfulness vindicated.</li>

        <h2>🏹 The Battles — Divine Judgment Imposed on Canaanite Chaos</h2>

        <div class="battle-grid">
            <div class="battle-card">
                <h4>Jericho (Josh 6)</h4>
                <p>The walls fall not by siege, but by the ark, the trumpets, and the shout of faith. The city is devoted to the Source — firstfruits of the conquest.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="battle-card">
                <h4>Ai (Josh 7-8)</h4>
                <p>First defeat because of Achan's sin. After judgment, victory through ambush — the Source teaches that holiness precedes conquest.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="battle-card">
                <h4>The Gibeonite Deception (Josh 9)</h4>
                <p>The nations, hearing of Jericho and Ai, resort to cunning. Israel fails to consult the Source, and makes a covenant. The Gibeonites become servants.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="battle-card">
                <h4>The Five Kings (Josh 10)</h4>
                <p>The Amorite kings attack Gibeon; Joshua fights. The Source fights from heaven with hailstones, and the sun stands still until victory is complete.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="battle-card">
                <h4>The Northern Coalition (Josh 11)</h4>
                <p>Jabin of Hazor gathers a vast army. The Source delivers them into Israel's hand — horses hamstrung, chariots burned.</p>
            </div>

        <h2>🗺️ The Division of the Land — Order Imposed on the Territory</h2>

        <div class="section-box">
            <p>The land is not conquered by Israel's might; it is given by the Source and distributed by lot. Each tribe receives its inheritance — not by merit, but by divine assignment. The Levites receive no land, for the Source Himself is their inheritance.</p>
            <p>This is the ultimate ordering of the medium: the chaos of Canaan, filled with nations devoted to idols, becomes the ordered inheritance of the tribes of Israel. The land itself is spoken into being as the dwelling place of the Source's people.</p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>📜 Joshua's Farewell — The Choice Set Before the People</h2>

        <div class="section-box">
            <p>At the end of his life, Joshua gathers the people and recites the Source's faithfulness:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"I gave you a land on which you had not labored" (Josh 24:13) — grace remembered.</li>
                <li>"Choose this day whom you will serve" (Josh 24:15) — the call to decision.</li>
                <li>"As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD" (Josh 24:15) — Joshua's own commitment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The people respond, "Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD." Joshua warns them: "You cannot serve the LORD, for he is a holy God." They insist, and a covenant is made.</p>
            <p>Joshua sets up a stone as a witness: "It has heard all the words that the LORD spoke to us." The people are sent to their inheritances — a people spoken into being, established in the land.</p>

        <h2>📐 Corrected Science-Bible Mappings</h2>

        <div class="correction-box">
            <h4>⚠️ Correction Notice</h4>
            <p><strong>Wrong:</strong> Treating Jericho's fall as "acoustic resonance chaos" (J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 2012) or the land allotments as "fractal partitioning" (Fractals 2021) as if they were natural phenomena.</p>
            <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Jericho's walls fell by divine command, not acoustic resonance. The land allotments are divine assignments, not fractal geography. The conquest is not tribal warfare; it is the Source's judgment on nations whose sin had reached its fullness. Joshua is not a record of natural expansion; it is the Logos speaking into the chaos of Canaan, establishing His people in the land of promise.</p>
